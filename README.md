## 🌿 Branching & Contribution Workflow

The repository uses a **feature-branch workflow**:

| Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main` | Stable, working code only (protected) |
| `feature/Umar` | Umar's assigned features |
| `feature/Areesha` | Areesha's assigned features |
| `feature/Farda` | Farda's assigned features |
| `feature/Mahnoor` | Mahnoor's assigned features |

**Rules:**
- All development happens on individual `feature/<name>` branches
- Direct commits to `main` are restricted to documentation and project configuration
- Completed features are merged into `main` via Pull Requests reviewed by the Team Lead

---

## 📌 Development Approach

The project follows a **console-first** approach, with GUI integration planned after core logic is complete.

| Phase | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Foundation — file formats, base classes, main menu | ✅ Done |
| Phase 2 | Test all 10 features working | 🔄 In Progress |
| Phase 3 | GUI integration | ⏳ Pending |
| Phase 4 | Final testing, GitHub cleanup, LinkedIn posts | ⏳ Pending |
